I'll review the recent code changes and simplify them. Let me start by examining what was modified.Let me read the full file to understand the context better and look for simplification opportunities.Now let me analyze the code for simplification opportunities:

1. **`Self` type alias** - Line 527 defines `const Self = @This()` but it's never used. The code uses `*Self` in function signatures but could use `*@This()` or simply `*EventBuilder` directly.

2. **Boolean flags `started` and `finished`** - These could potentially be combined or simplified, but they serve distinct purposes:
   - `started` tracks whether we've called decode() 
   - `finished` tracks whether we've emitted all events

3. **The `nextEvent` function** - The structure is clean but the `else => continue` branch in `.iterating` for primitives is unreachable because primitives transition directly to `.done` in `.start`.

Let me verify this and look for other simplifications:I've identified several simplification opportunities:

1. **Remove unused `Self` alias** (line 527) - it's defined but never used
2. **The `else` branch in `.iterating`** (lines 629-632) is unreachable since primitives are handled in `.start` and transition directly to `.done`
3. **Simplify accessing the last stack frame** - use `getLast()` instead of manual index calculation

Let me also check if there are any other patterns in the codebase:So `Self` is used elsewhere. Let me check if it's actually used in EventBuilder:Good - `Self` is used at lines 530, 543, 563, 646, and 657 in the EventBuilder. So we need to keep it.

Let me make the simplifications:

1. **Remove the unreachable `else` branch** in `.iterating` - this code path can never be hit because primitives go from `.start` directly to `.done`, skipping `.iterating`
2. **Simplify stack access** - use `getLast()` instead of manual indexingWait, I need to check if `getLastOrNull()` returns a pointer. Let me verify:Right, `getLastOrNull()` returns a value, not a pointer. Let me fix this - I need to keep the manual indexing to get a mutable pointer:Tests pass. Let me update the todo list and view the simplified code:The changes are:
1. Removed unnecessary braces/blocks for single-return switch arms
2. Removed verbose comments that didn't add value
3. Replaced unreachable `else` branch with explicit `unreachable` on primitive types - this makes the invariant explicit (primitives go from `.start` directly to `.done`, never hitting `.iterating`)

Now let me commit these changes:Done. I reviewed the EventBuilder code from the recent "Decoder - Event Builder" commit and made the following simplifications:

**Changes made:**
1. Collapsed single-statement switch arms to inline form (removed unnecessary braces)
2. Removed verbose comments that stated the obvious
3. Replaced the unreachable `else` branch with explicit `unreachable` on primitive types (`.null, .bool, .number, .string => unreachable`) - this makes the invariant clear: primitives transition directly from `.start` to `.done`, so they can never be in the `.iterating` state

**Result:** 5 lines added, 20 lines removed - net reduction of 15 lines while preserving all functionality. Tests pass.
