I'll review the recent code changes and simplify them if needed. Let me start by examining what was modified.Let me read the new value.zig file to review it for simplification opportunities.Let me also check the root.zig changes.Now let me run the tests to ensure the current code works before making any simplifications.Tests pass. Now let me analyze the code for simplification opportunities. I've identified a few areas:

1. **Lines 314, 362**: `toOwnedSlice` can fail but `catch unreachable` is used - this is a code smell since the allocator already has memory. However, for ArrayListUnmanaged, toOwnedSlice can actually fail if the capacity > length and reallocation fails. But the pattern is acceptable since we're shrinking.

2. **Lines 116-126**: The `fromSlice` loop could be simplified using idiomatic Zig patterns.

3. **Lines 353-356**: The errdefer in `putClone` uses a mutable copy pattern that's slightly verbose.

Let me look more closely at potential simplifications:After careful review, I found a few simplifications:

1. **`putClone` errdefer** (lines 353-356): The mutable copy pattern can be avoided by directly calling deinit on the value union.

2. **Minor consistency**: The builders' `deinit` don't reset state, but they don't need to since they're typically discarded after use.

3. **`toOwnedSlice` with `catch unreachable`**: This is actually safe because `toOwnedSlice` only fails when trying to shrink and reallocation fails, but when shrinking, Zig's allocator interface guarantees no failure. However, the API technically returns an error. The current pattern is acceptable.

Let me make the one meaningful simplification - the `putClone` errdefer:Tests pass. Now let me commit the simplification.Done. I reviewed the Value Types code in `src/value.zig` and made one simplification:

**Change**: In `ObjectBuilder.putClone` (line 349), simplified the errdefer pattern from a block-scoped mutable copy to a direct mutable binding. This removes 3 lines while preserving identical behavior.

The rest of the code is already clean and follows good Zig idioms. The `catch unreachable` patterns in `toOwnedArray`/`toOwnedObject` are acceptable because shrinking allocations don't fail in practice.
