Now let me run the tests first to establish a baseline, then use the code-simplifier agent to review and simplify the code.Tests pass. Now let me invoke the code-simplifier agent to review and simplify the parser.zig code.The code-simplifier agent made three simplifications to the parser.zig file:

1. **Removed empty validation block in `parseKey`** - An if-statement that checked validation but did nothing with the result was removed.

2. **Simplified `detectRootForm` function** - Refactored from 38 lines with multiple if-statements to 12 lines using `orelse` for early return and a single switch statement.

3. **Simplified `parseDelimitedPrimitives` function** - Removed redundant quoted-check logic that was effectively dead code (tokens were already unquoted by the scanner).

All 206 tests pass. Let me verify the changes and commit them.Tests pass. The changes look good:

1. **Removed empty validation block** - The if-statement that did nothing was removed
2. **Simplified `parseDelimitedPrimitives`** - Removed dead code that checked for quotes after tokens were already unquoted
3. **Simplified `detectRootForm`** - Refactored from 38 lines to 12 using `orelse` and a switch statement

Let me commit these simplifications.Done. The code simplification removed 50 net lines from parser.zig while preserving all functionality:

- **Removed empty validation block in `parseKey`** - An if-statement that validated but ignored the result
- **Simplified `parseDelimitedPrimitives`** - Removed dead code checking for quotes after tokens were already unquoted by the scanner
- **Refactored `detectRootForm`** - From 38 lines with multiple if-statements to 12 lines using `orelse` and an exhaustive switch

All 206 tests pass. Committed as `4e2c37c`.
