I'll implement the Literal Utilities module. Let me first explore the codebase structure to understand where this should go and what patterns are already in place.Now I understand the codebase structure. Based on the SPEC.md and TESTING.md, I need to implement literal utilities per TESTING.md Section 2 which mentions `shared/literal_utils.zig` with functions:
- `isBooleanOrNullLiteral`
- `isNumericLiteral`
- `isNumericLike`

Let me also check if there's a `shared/` directory structure planned.Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. The TESTING.md mentions `shared/literal_utils.zig` for the literal utilities module. I need to create this module with the functions specified:

1. `isBooleanOrNullLiteral` - checks if a string is "true", "false", or "null"
2. `isNumericLiteral` - checks if a string is a valid number literal
3. `isNumericLike` - checks if a string looks like it could be a number (for quoting decisions)

Looking at the SPEC.md, I see the relevant sections:
- Section 2.1 describes number representation
- Section 3.5 describes quoting rules (when something "looks like" a number/boolean/null)

Let me create the literal utilities module.Now I need to update root.zig to export the new module.All tests pass. Let me also verify by running with more verbosity to see the tests actually ran.All 25 tests pass (the module tests plus the existing tests from constants.zig and errors.zig). Now let me commit this change.**Task completed successfully.**

I implemented the Literal Utilities module at `src/shared/literal_utils.zig` with:

1. **`isBooleanOrNullLiteral`** - Returns true for exactly "true", "false", or "null"
2. **`isBooleanLiteral`** - Returns true for exactly "true" or "false"
3. **`isNullLiteral`** - Returns true for exactly "null"
4. **`isNumericLiteral`** - Strict JSON number grammar validation (handles integers, decimals, exponents, rejects leading zeros like "007")
5. **`isNumericLike`** - Looser check for encoder quoting decisions (anything starting with a digit or minus-digit)
6. **`classifyLiteral`** - Categorizes a token into `LiteralKind` enum

The module is exported via `root.zig` and all 25 tests pass. Committed as `387d1da`.
