I'll implement the Event Builder for the decoder. Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand what exists and what I need to build.Now let me read the relevant existing files to understand the current state of the codebase:Now let me also check the value.zig to understand the Value types I'll be emitting events for:Now I have a full understanding of the codebase. The Event Builder should convert the decoded TOON (as a Value tree) into a stream of `JsonStreamEvent` events. This is needed for streaming decode pipelines. Let me implement the Event Builder in the decoder module.Now let me implement the Event Builder. I'll add a streaming decoder that emits `JsonStreamEvent` events from TOON input.Now let me add tests for the Event Builder:Now let me add the Event Builder tests at the end of the file:Now let me update the todo and run the tests:All tests pass. Let me also run a quick verification with a specific decoder test filter to ensure the new tests are running:Tests pass. Let me update the todo and proceed with the commit:Now let me commit:The Decoder Event Builder task is complete.

**Summary:**

I implemented the Event Builder for the TOON decoder which converts decoded TOON input into a stream of `JsonStreamEvent` events. This enables streaming pipelines and event-based processing of TOON documents.

**What was added:**

1. **`EventBuilder` struct** (`src/decoder.zig:508-667`):
   - Iterator interface with `init()`, `next()`, and `deinit()` methods
   - Stack-based traversal for depth-first event emission
   - Handles all value types: objects, arrays, and primitives

2. **Public API functions**:
   - `decodeToEvents(allocator, input)` - Decode to event slice with default options
   - `decodeToEventsWithOptions(allocator, input, options)` - Decode with custom options

3. **Event sequence** per SPEC.md Section 9.2:
   - Object: `start_object(count)` -> `(key, value_events)*` -> `end_object`
   - Array: `start_array(count)` -> `(value_events)*` -> `end_array`
   - Primitive: `primitive(value)`

4. **Comprehensive tests** covering:
   - Simple and nested objects
   - Simple and tabular arrays
   - All primitive types (string, number, bool, null)
   - Empty objects and arrays
   - Single primitive at root
   - Iterator interface behavior

**Validation**: `zig build test` passes with all tests.
