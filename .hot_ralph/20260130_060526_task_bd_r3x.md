I'll implement the validation utilities for the tzu project. Let me first explore the existing codebase structure to understand where to add this module and what validation functions are needed.Now let me check the errors module to understand the error types available.Now I have a complete understanding of the codebase. Based on TESTING.md which specifies validation functions in `shared/validation.zig` (line 86), and SPEC.md sections on:
- Key validation (Section 3.2): unquoted key pattern `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*$`
- String quoting rules (Section 3.5): when strings need quotes
- Key folding (Section 3.6): identifier segment pattern `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`

Let me create the validation utilities module.Now I need to update the root.zig to export the new validation module.Tests pass. Let me also run the tests specifically for the validation module to see the test output.That's expected - the direct test doesn't have the module paths configured. The `zig build test` command passed, which is the proper way to run tests. Let me also verify by running the build to check for compilation errors.Now let me commit the changes.**Task completed successfully.**

I've implemented the validation utilities module (`src/shared/validation.zig`) with the following functions:

**Key Validation:**
- `isValidUnquotedKey` - Validates keys per SPEC.md Section 3.2 pattern `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.]*$`
- `isValidIdentifierSegment` - Validates identifier segments for key folding (no dots allowed)
- `isValidFoldablePath` - Validates dotted paths for key folding/expansion

**Value Quoting Requirements:**
- `isSafeUnquoted` - Checks if a value can be used unquoted (all delimiters)
- `isSafeUnquotedWithDelimiter` - Checks with a specific delimiter
- `keyNeedsQuoting` - Convenience wrapper for key quoting decisions
- `valueNeedsQuoting` - Convenience wrapper for value quoting decisions

**Indentation Validation:**
- `validateIndentation` - Validates spaces-only indentation as a multiple of indent size
- `countLeadingSpaces` - Counts leading spaces without validation

**Array Header Validation:**
- `isArrayCountChar` - Checks if a character is a valid count digit
- `isValidArrayCount` - Validates array count strings (no leading zeros except "0")

All tests pass with `zig build test`. The module is exported from `root.zig` as `validation`.
