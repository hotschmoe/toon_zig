The code simplification is complete. The agent:

1. Reviewed the recent changes for the "Stream Events and Options" task
2. Found and removed unnecessary `Self` type aliases from `EncodeOptions` and `DecodeOptions` structs, replacing them with explicit type names
3. Kept the `Self` alias in `JsonStreamEvent` where it's used extensively and adds clarity
4. Verified all tests pass
5. Committed the changes as `refactor: simplify code from bd-1a4`
