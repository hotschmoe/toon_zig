The code simplification is complete. The agent found and applied one improvement:

**Simplified `peekNonBlankStrict` in `src/decoder.zig`:**
- Renamed to `peekNonBlankInArray` (clearer purpose)
- Removed the `in_array` parameter since it was always `true` at all call sites
- Simplified the conditional check
- Removed redundant comments

All tests pass. Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
