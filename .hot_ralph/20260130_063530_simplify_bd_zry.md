The code-simplifier agent completed successfully. Here's what was simplified in the scanner module:

## Simplifications Made to `src/scanner.zig`

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Removed unused import** | `literal_utils` was imported but never used |
| **Simplified parseKey return** | Removed unnecessary intermediate variable |
| **Simplified empty array case** | Used `&.{}` instead of allocating an empty slice |
| **Consolidated delimiter parsing** | Changed mutable `var` to `const` with a switch expression |

All tests pass. The changes reduced approximately 13 lines while preserving identical functionality.

Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
