I'll implement a constants module for tzu. Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand what exists and what constants are needed based on the specifications.Now let me check the build.zig to understand the module structure:Now I have a clear understanding. Based on the SPEC.md, I need to create a constants module that defines the core constants for TOON format implementation. Let me create this module with all the necessary constants derived from the specification.Now I need to export this module from root.zig so it's accessible to library consumers:Now let's run the tests to validate the implementation:Tests pass. Let me also verify the module compiles correctly and can be used:I need to update main.zig to work with the new root.zig:The API changed in Zig 0.15. Let me check the correct API:The Zig 0.15 API requires a buffer for the writer. Let me fix this:Build and tests pass. Let me verify the executable works:Now let me commit the changes:**Success.** The constants module has been implemented and committed.

**Summary of changes:**

1. **`src/constants.zig`** - New module containing:
   - Format metadata: spec version "3.0", file extension ".toon", media type
   - `Delimiter` enum with comma, pipe, and tab variants
   - Indentation constants (default 2 spaces, min/max, forbidden tabs)
   - Line termination (LF only)
   - Syntax characters (colon, quotes, brackets, braces, list marker, path separator)
   - Escape sequence mappings with `unescapeChar()` and `escapeChar()` helper functions
   - Literal strings (null, true, false)
   - Character validation functions: `isKeyStartChar`, `isKeyChar`, `isIdentifierStartChar`, `isIdentifierChar`, `isDigit`, `isNumberStartChar`, `isNumberChar`
   - Option enums: `KeyFoldingMode`, `ExpandPathsMode`
   - Unit tests for all functionality

2. **`src/root.zig`** - Updated to export the constants module and commonly used types

3. **`src/main.zig`** - Updated to use the new library structure, displays spec version on startup
