The code simplification task is complete. The agent reviewed the decoder array implementation and made the following improvements:

**Changes Made:**

1. **Simplified array header handling in `decodeNestedValue`** - Flattened nested conditionals and eliminated redundant header fetching. The code now accesses the header once upfront rather than checking it multiple times.

2. **Simplified nested content check in `decodeKeyValue`** - Removed an unnecessary intermediate boolean variable and combined the condition check directly.

**Results:**
- Net reduction of 6 lines of code
- Reduced nesting depth for better readability
- Removed comments that described obvious code flow
- All tests pass
- Changes committed as "refactor: simplify code from bd-2e7"
