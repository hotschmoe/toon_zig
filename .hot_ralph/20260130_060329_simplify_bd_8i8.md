The code looks well-structured overall. Let me also check the constants module that's being referenced to understand the full context.Now I have full context. Let me run the tests first to ensure everything is working, then look for potential simplifications.Tests pass. Now let me analyze the code for simplification opportunities.

Looking at `string_utils.zig`, I see a few potential improvements:

1. **`quoteString` does an unnecessary intermediate allocation** - it escapes the string, allocates for the result, copies, then frees the escaped string. This can be simplified to a single allocation by calculating the size upfront.

2. **Redundant `errdefer` in `escapeString`** - on line 35, there's an `errdefer allocator.free(result)` but the function only returns `Allocator.Error` which would only happen during the alloc call itself. After that, there's no way for the function to error, so the errdefer is never triggered.

3. **Same issue in `unescapeString`** - line 98 has an errdefer that's never triggered (no error returns after allocation).

Let me make these simplifications.Now for `quoteString` - I can calculate the escaped size directly and build the result in one allocation.All tests pass. Let me show you the diff of the simplifications.The simplifications are complete. Summary of changes:

1. **Removed unnecessary `errdefer` in `escapeString`** (line 35) - After allocation succeeds, the function cannot error, making the errdefer dead code.

2. **Removed unnecessary `errdefer` in `unescapeString`** (line 98) - Same situation - after allocation and validation complete, no errors are possible.

3. **Optimized `quoteString`** - Previously allocated an intermediate escaped string, copied it, then freed it. Now calculates size directly and writes in one pass with a single allocation. This eliminates an allocation/deallocation pair.

Would you like me to commit these changes?
