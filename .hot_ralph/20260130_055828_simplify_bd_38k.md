I'll review the recently modified code for the Literal Utilities task and simplify it using the code-simplifier agent.The code simplification is complete. The agent reviewed the literal utilities code from commit 387d1da and made the following improvements:

**Changes made to `src/shared/literal_utils.zig`:**

1. **Simplified `isNumericLike` function** - reduced from 16 lines to 4 lines by combining conditionals into a single expression
2. **Removed unreachable bounds check** in `isNumericLiteral` - the check was redundant given prior validation
3. **Removed unnecessary inline comment** - the code was self-explanatory

**Result:** -18 net lines removed while preserving all functionality. Tests pass and the changes have been committed as "refactor: simplify code from bd-38k".
