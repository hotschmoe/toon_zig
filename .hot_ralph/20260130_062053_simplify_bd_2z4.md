The code-simplifier agent has completed its work. Here's a summary:

**Committed:** `c1180bd` - refactor: simplify code from bd-2z4

**Simplifications made to `src/value.zig`:**

1. **Extracted `normalizeFloat()` helper** - Consolidated duplicated NaN/Infinity/negative-zero handling logic used by both `.float` and `.number_string` cases

2. **Removed labeled blocks** - Replaced `blk: { break :blk value; }` patterns with direct returns for cleaner control flow

3. **Simplified errdefer** - Changed unnecessary pattern `const value = ...; errdefer { var v = value; v.deinit(...); }` to simpler `var value = ...; errdefer value.deinit(...);`

4. **Removed redundant comments** - Stripped comments that restated obvious code behavior

**Result:** ~20 fewer lines, all 31 tests pass, no behavior changes.
