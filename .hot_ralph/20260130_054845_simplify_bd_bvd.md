I'll review the recent code changes for the Constants Module task and simplify if needed.The code-simplifier agent found and made two small improvements:

**Changes Made:**
1. **Removed unused `valid_escapes` constant** - Dead code that was never referenced (escape logic uses `escape_mappings` array instead)
2. **Simplified `isIdentifierStartChar`** - Was a duplicate function with identical logic to `isKeyStartChar`, now defined as `pub const isIdentifierStartChar = isKeyStartChar;`

**Tests pass** - all functionality preserved.

Let me verify the changes look good:Good changes. Let me run tests to confirm everything still works:Tests pass. The simplifications are clean and safe. Would you like me to commit these changes?
