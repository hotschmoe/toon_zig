I'll review the recent code changes and simplify them. Let me start by examining what was modified.Now let me see the actual diff to understand the specific changes made.I've reviewed the changes. The code is well-written but I see a significant simplification opportunity: `parseDelimitedTokens` and `parseDelimitedValues` share almost identical logic. The only difference is one returns `ParsedToken` and the other `[]const u8`.

Looking more closely:

1. **Code duplication**: `parseDelimitedTokens` and `parseDelimitedValues` have the same loop structure.
2. **`parseFieldValue` is now only used in one place** - inside `parseDelimitedValues`.

However, since both functions are public and `parseDelimitedValues` is used elsewhere for field lists (which don't need quoting info), I should be careful not to break that use case.

Let me check if there's a simpler approach - can `parseDelimitedValues` be implemented in terms of `parseDelimitedTokens`?Good - `parseDelimitedValues` is used in two places:
1. `parser.zig:403` - for parsing field lists in array headers  
2. `scanner.zig:434` - same purpose within Scanner

These use cases just need the string values (for field names), not the quoting info. So we can simplify by implementing `parseDelimitedValues` in terms of `parseDelimitedTokens` to eliminate the duplicated loop logic.Now `parseFieldValue` is no longer used. Let me verify and remove it.`parseFieldValue` is now dead code - only defined, never called. Let me remove it.Now let me run the tests to verify everything works correctly.All tests pass. Let me also verify the build works.Let me see the final diff to confirm the simplification.Done. I simplified the value parsing code by:

1. **Eliminated code duplication**: `parseDelimitedValues` now delegates to `parseDelimitedTokens` instead of having its own copy of the parsing loop
2. **Removed dead code**: Deleted `parseFieldValue` which was no longer needed after the refactoring

The result is a net reduction of 33 lines (42 deleted, 9 added) while preserving all functionality. Tests pass.
