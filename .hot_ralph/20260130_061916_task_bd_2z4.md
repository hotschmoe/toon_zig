I'll implement bidirectional conversion between `std.json.Value` and our `JsonValue` type. Let me start by reading the current `value.zig` to understand the existing structure.Now I have a clear picture of the existing `Value` type. I need to add bidirectional conversion functions between `std.json.Value` and our `Value` type. Let me add the conversion functions.Now I need to add tests for the conversion functions. Let me add them at the end of the test section.Now let me add tests for the conversion functions at the end of the file.Now let me run the tests to verify everything works.Minor issue - need to change `var` to `const`. Let me fix that.All tests pass. Now let me commit the changes with a message based on the task title.Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**
- Added `fromStdJson(allocator, std.json.Value) -> !Value` - converts `std.json.Value` to our internal `Value` type
- Added `toStdJson(allocator, Value) -> !std.json.Value` - converts back for JSON stringification

**Features implemented:**
- Handles all JSON types: null, bool, integer, float, string, array, object, number_string
- Per SPEC.md Section 2.1: NaN/Infinity normalize to null, -0 normalizes to 0
- Recursive handling for nested arrays and objects
- Proper memory management with errdefer for cleanup on errors

**Validation passed:**
- `zig build test` passes (all 47 tests including 17 new conversion tests)
- Roundtrip test verifies `std.json.Value -> Value -> std.json.Value` preserves semantics
