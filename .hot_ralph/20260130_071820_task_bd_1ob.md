I'll analyze this task to understand what "Decoder - Validation" means in the context of this project. Let me first explore the current state of the codebase to understand what validation features need to be implemented.The exploration reveals that the decoder is largely implemented, but the key missing piece for strict mode validation is **BlankLineInArray validation**. Let me read the relevant files to understand the current implementation and implement this missing validation.Now I have a clear picture. The task "Decoder - Validation" needs me to implement the missing **BlankLineInArray** validation per SPEC.md Section 7. Let me create a todo list and implement this.Looking at the decoder code, the issue is that `peekNonBlank()` silently skips blank lines. In strict mode, when we're inside an array scope, we need to detect and reject blank lines.

The key places where arrays are decoded are:
1. `decodeTabularArray` - uses `peekNonBlank` in the loop
2. `decodeExpandedArray` - uses `peekNonBlank` in the loop  
3. `decodeInferredArray` - uses `peekNonBlank` in the loop

The fix should check for blank lines when we're inside an array context in strict mode. Let me implement this by adding a version of peek that validates blank lines in array context.Now I need to update the array decoding functions to use `peekNonBlankStrict` instead of `peekNonBlank`. Let me update each one.Now let me update my todo and add tests for the BlankLineInArray validation.Now let me add tests for the BlankLineInArray validation at the end of the file.All tests pass. Let me also run the decoder-specific tests to confirm the new tests are being executed.All 244 tests pass, including the 3 new BlankLineInArray validation tests. Let me update the todo and commit.**Task completed successfully.**

## Summary

Implemented the missing **BlankLineInArray validation** for strict mode as specified in SPEC.md Section 7.

### Changes Made

**src/decoder.zig:103-117** - Added `peekNonBlankStrict()` method that:
- Rejects blank lines when `strict=true` and `in_array=true`
- Returns `BlankLineInArray` error per SPEC.md Section 6.1
- Silently skips blank lines when in lenient mode

**Modified array decoding functions** to use `peekNonBlankStrict(true)`:
- `decodeTabularArray` (line 298)
- `decodeExpandedArray` (line 344)
- `decodeInferredArray` (line 472)

**Added 3 new tests:**
1. `decode blank line in expanded array strict mode` - verifies error is raised
2. `decode blank line in tabular array strict mode` - verifies error is raised
3. `decode blank line in array allowed in lenient mode` - verifies lenient parsing works

### Validation

- All 244 tests pass
- Strict mode now enforces all SPEC.md Section 7 requirements:
  - Indentation multiples
  - No tabs in indentation
  - Array count validation
  - **No blank lines in arrays** (newly implemented)
  - Field count match in tabular arrays
  - Valid escapes only
