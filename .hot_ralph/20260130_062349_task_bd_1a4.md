I'll analyze the task description to understand what "Stream Events and Options" means. Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand what exists and what needs to be implemented.Let me read the existing files to understand the current implementation state:Now I understand the codebase. Looking at the SPEC.md and VISION.md, I need to implement "Stream Events and Options" which refers to:

1. **JsonStreamEvent** - streaming decoder events (SPEC.md Section 9.2)
2. **EncodeOptions** - encoder options (SPEC.md Section 5.1)
3. **DecodeOptions** - decoder options (SPEC.md Section 5.2)

Let me check if there's more context in the beads issues:I see that task `bd-1a4` is "Stream Events and Options" and it depends on `bd-1j2` (Value Types) which is now closed. Looking at the dependency chain, the Scanner Module (`bd-zry`) depends on this task, which means I need to implement the stream events and options that will be used by the scanner.

Based on SPEC.md:
- Section 5.1: EncodeOptions
- Section 5.2: DecodeOptions
- Section 9.2: decodeStream returns iterator of JsonStreamEvent

Let me create a todo list and implement this:Now let me implement the stream events and options. I'll create a new file `src/stream.zig` for the streaming types:Now let me update root.zig to export the new stream module and types:Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation:Tests pass. Let me update the todo and commit the changes:Task completed successfully.

**Summary:**

Implemented `src/stream.zig` with:

1. **JsonStreamEvent** - A union type for streaming decode/encode events:
   - `start_object` with count
   - `end_object`
   - `key` with string
   - `start_array` with count
   - `end_array`
   - `primitive` with Value
   - Includes `deinit`, `clone`, `eql`, and `format` methods

2. **EncodeOptions** (SPEC.md Section 5.1):
   - `indent: u8 = 2`
   - `delimiter: Delimiter = .comma`
   - `key_folding: KeyFoldingMode = .off`
   - `flatten_depth: usize = maxInt`

3. **DecodeOptions** (SPEC.md Section 5.2):
   - `indent: u8 = 2`
   - `strict: bool = true`
   - `expand_paths: ExpandPathsMode = .off`

All types are exported from `root.zig` and all tests pass.
