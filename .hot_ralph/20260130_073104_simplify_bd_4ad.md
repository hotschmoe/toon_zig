I'll review the recent code changes for the Decoder Main API task and simplify where appropriate.The code simplifier agent has completed its review. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## Simplifications Made to Decoder Main API

### 1. `decodeToWriter` - Fixed misleading documentation
Removed the false claim about "memory-efficient streaming output" since the function actually builds the entire Value tree in memory before writing.

### 2. `writeJsonString` - Removed redundant comments
The function name is self-documenting, and the removed comments were stating the obvious.

### 3. `writeJsonNumber` - Streamlined implementation
- Removed obvious comments
- Inlined single-use variable directly into the format call

All tests pass after these simplifications. Let me commit these changes.Tests pass. Now I'll commit the simplification changes.Done. The simplification review is complete:

**Changes committed (2d40f0a):**
- Removed misleading "memory-efficient streaming" claim from `decodeToWriter` doc comment (the function builds the full Value tree in memory)
- Removed redundant doc comments and inline comments that were stating the obvious
- Inlined single-use `int_val` variable in `writeJsonNumber`

All tests pass. The code is now cleaner and more honest about what it actually does.
