The code-simplifier agent completed its review and made the following improvements to the validation utilities:

**Changes made to `src/shared/validation.zig`:**

1. **Removed unused import** - The `string_utils` import was never used and has been removed.

2. **Consolidated duplicate code** - The `isSafeUnquoted` and `isSafeUnquotedWithDelimiter` functions had nearly identical implementations (~40 lines each). These were refactored to use a shared private `isSafeUnquotedCore` function, eliminating ~30 lines of duplicated code.

All tests pass, confirming functionality is preserved. Would you like me to commit these simplification changes?
