Let me read the encoder.zig file to review the changes.Now let me run the code-simplifier agent to review and simplify the code.Good. The agent found and made two simplifications. Let me verify the tests still pass and review the actual changes made.Tests pass and the changes look good. The simplifications are:

1. **`encodeNumber`**: Replaced the verbose `if ... |err|` pattern with idiomatic `try` - cleaner and more readable.

2. **`writeQuoted` helper**: Extracted the duplicated quoted string writing logic from both `writeString` and `writeKey` into a shared helper function.

Let me commit these changes.Done. The simplification changes have been committed:

**Summary of simplifications to `src/encoder.zig`:**

1. **`encodeNumber` (line 229-232)**: Replaced verbose `if ... |err|` error handling pattern with idiomatic `try` - cleaner and more readable Zig code.

2. **New `writeQuoted` helper (line 288-300)**: Extracted the duplicated 10-line quoted string writing logic that was repeated in both `writeString` and `writeKey` into a shared helper function, reducing code duplication.

The net result is 7 fewer lines of code while maintaining all functionality. All tests pass.
