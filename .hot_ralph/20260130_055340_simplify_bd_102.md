I'll review the recent code changes for the Error Types task and simplify if needed.The code-simplifier agent reviewed the Error Types changes and made minor improvements:

**Files Reviewed:**
- `src/errors.zig` - The new error types module

**Simplifications Made:**
1. Renamed test `"all error types are distinct"` → `"error set has expected count"` (name now accurately reflects what the test verifies)
2. Renamed local variable `errors` → `error_list` to avoid confusion with the `Error` type

**Assessment:** The code is well-structured overall - clean error categorization, idiomatic Zig patterns in the `Result` type, and comprehensive tests. All tests pass.

Let me commit these simplification changes:Tests pass. Now I'll commit the simplification changes:Done. The Error Types code has been reviewed and simplified:

**Summary:**
- Renamed test from `"all error types are distinct"` to `"error set has expected count"` (more accurate)
- Renamed variable `errors` to `error_list` (avoids confusion with the `Error` type)
- Removed redundant comment
- All tests pass
- Changes committed: `1ef7e34`
