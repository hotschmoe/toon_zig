I'll implement the string utilities for the TOON Zig project. Let me first explore the existing codebase structure to understand what's already in place.Let me read the existing files to understand the structure and what utilities are already implemented.Now I have a good understanding of the codebase. I need to implement string utilities as specified in TESTING.md Section 2 (Unit Tests Coverage targets):
- `escapeString`, `unescapeString`, `findClosingQuote`

Let me also check what the SPEC.md says about escape sequences (Section 2.2).Now I'll implement the string utilities module. Based on SPEC.md Section 2.2:
- Escape sequences: `\\` (backslash), `\"` (double quote), `\n` (newline), `\r` (carriage return), `\t` (tab)
- Invalid escapes trigger an error in strict mode
- No Unicode escapes (`\uXXXX`) - UTF-8 is used directlyNow let me update `root.zig` to export the new string_utils module.Now let me run the tests to validate the implementation.I have a test failure - let me recalculate the expected index. The input is `"hello \"world\" end\"rest"` and I need to find the first unescaped quote.

Let me trace through:
- `h` (0), `e` (1), `l` (2), `l` (3), `o` (4), ` ` (5), `\` (6), `"` (7) -> skip (escape), 
- `w` (8), `o` (9), `r` (10), `l` (11), `d` (12), `\` (13), `"` (14) -> skip (escape),
- ` ` (15), `e` (16), `n` (17), `d` (18), `"` (19) -> FOUND!

The expected value should be 19, not 20. Let me fix the test.All tests pass. Let me update the todo list and commit the changes.**Task completed successfully.**

I implemented the String Utilities module (`src/shared/string_utils.zig`) with the following functions as specified in TESTING.md:

1. **`escapeString`** - Converts special characters to escape sequences for TOON output
2. **`unescapeString`** - Converts escape sequences back to original characters, with error handling for invalid escapes
3. **`findClosingQuote`** - Finds the closing quote in a quoted string, handling escape sequences

Additional helper functions included:
- **`needsEscaping`** - Checks if a string contains escapable characters
- **`parseQuotedString`** - Extracts and unescapes content from a quoted string
- **`quoteString`** - Wraps a string in quotes with proper escaping

The implementation follows SPEC.md Section 2.2, supporting the five escape sequences:
- `\\` (backslash)
- `\"` (double quote)  
- `\n` (newline U+000A)
- `\r` (carriage return U+000D)
- `\t` (tab U+0009)

All 58 tests pass, including comprehensive roundtrip tests verifying `escape`/`unescape` and `quote`/`parse` are inverse operations.
